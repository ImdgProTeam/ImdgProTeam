- 👋 Hi, We're @ImdgProTeam
- 👀 Currently we are creating an application for checking of stowage and segregation of IMDG cargo to be used onboard container vessels.
- 🌱 Free console version has been developed and is maintained in C#. Desktop version is being developed using WPF technology.  
- 💞️ As team is very small, all the participants are employed and work on the project is done during our free time only, 
we are seeking for any help with application design and its functionality.
- 📫 Contact us on prodg@imdg.pro
